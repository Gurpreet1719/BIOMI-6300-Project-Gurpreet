Details:
1. Number of samples: 60
2. General file sizes: 1018.72 Mb
3. Bioproject (613763) and sequence accession number (PRJNA613763)
	
This paper aims to optimize N management and balance crop yields. It also describes the role of microorganisms in performing the ecosystem functions and maintaining soil health. The objectives of this study which are addressed in the class project are:
		a. Examining the trends in the diversity and richness of wheat rhizosphere soil bacterial communities relating to the different nitrogen fertilizer levels.  
		b. Effects of fertilization on the diversity and microbial community composition in both short and long terms

**Details about DNA sequencing and primers:**
1. 16S rRNA gene sequencing using Illumina MiSeq technique
2. The V3–V4 hypervariable regions of the bacteria 16S rRNA gene were amplified with primers 338F (5′-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′) and 806R (5′-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3′)
